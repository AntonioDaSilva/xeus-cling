# Xeus-Cling Jupyter Notebook with C++ for 'math+econ+code'

Please use the following link to launch an example C++ Jupyter Notebook in the binder. Note that the environment is set up to include the C++ library `armadillo`, however, the package is built without `hdf5` library due to building constraints in the binder (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70801835/how-can-i-include-openblas-and-lapack-manually-in-xeus-cling-binder))
